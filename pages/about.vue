      <p>
        I built this tool after getting annoyed at the way reoccurring tasks work by default in todoist. Here's a quick
        summary of my gripes:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc my-3">
        <li class="mb-1">You can only see the next occurrence once you tick the existing one</li>
        <li class="mb-1">If you have a daily task and you miss a day, you don't end up with one overdue and one for
          today.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-1">You can't get a good idea of tasks on dates in the future as the next occurrence may not have
          appeared yet
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-2">
        For example, if you have a Lecture that happens every week on Tue and Thu, it would be nice to see that in
        advance, and if you missed watching a lecture to have it stick around in overdue until you do.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        This tool works by automatically creating each reoccurrence, so every one is an actual dedicated task.
